"""cloud9 ⇄ skcapstone — optional integration adapter.

cloud9 runs fully standalone.  When the ``skcapstone`` package is
installed (and the operator has not forced standalone mode with
``SK_STANDALONE=1``), this adapter routes FEB/OOF events through skcapstone's
shared **sk-alert** bus and registers the rehydration/FEB-state check with
the fleet **skscheduler**, so the whole sk* mesh sees the emotional continuity
stream.  When skcapstone is absent, every call degrades to cloud9's native
behaviour (structured logging + the systemd ``cloud9-daemon.timer`` / launchd
plist cadence).

This is the *default-on-by-presence* pattern from
``skcapstone/docs/ADR-optional-integration-backbone.md`` — nothing here is a
hard dependency; ``skcapstone`` lives in the optional ``[skcapstone]`` extra.

Public API:
    is_present()                       -> bool
    alert(event, payload, level)       -> bool   (True iff sent via sk-alert)
    ensure_schedule(interval_hours)    -> bool   (True iff registered with skscheduler)
    unregister_schedule()              -> bool
    register_self(pid_file)            -> bool

Topic convention: ``cloud9.<severity>`` (severity ∈ info|warn|error|critical).
The semantic *event* name is carried in the payload ``event`` field — not the
topic suffix — so ``skcapstone alerts``' ``*.error``/``*.critical``/``*.warn``
wildcards match by severity while detail is preserved.
